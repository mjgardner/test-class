0.32_1 - or the "Birmingham QA 2009" release
    -   Removed pointless use of Test::Exception in t/bad-autoloads.t to stop
        bogus warnings that were confusing some folk
    -   Added add_testinfo for Test::Class::Sugar (thanks Piers Cawley)

0.31 - or the "good god adrian is still alive" release
    -   Downgraded IO::File dependancy to 1.09 (RT#38424 - thanks Mark Stosberg)

0.30 - or the "Oslo QA 2008 #2" release
    -   Move up to depend on Test::Simple 0.78 to stomp on RT##33809

0.29 - or the "Oslo QA 2008" release
    -   Fixed some broken edge cases where you didn't get a plan when you had
        tests in a shutdown method, and no tests in the rest of your class
    -   Test::Class::Load can now be subclassed so you can add your own filters
        for what is considered a test class (patch from Cosimo Streppone)
    -   Described minimum perl as '5.006001' rather than '5.6.1' so old perls
        understand what we're talking about.
    -   Fixed typo in docs (thanks Tony Edwardson)

0.28 - or the "just for the debian folk" release
    -   Downgraded some dependencies to avoid some bogus warnings on Debian
        (thanks Gunnar Wolf & Hynek)

0.27 - or the "Adrian cannot write in English" release
    -   Fixed a couple of typos/grammar stupidities (thank Jim Brandt)

0.26 - or the "really working on windows this time (fingers crossed)" release
    -   Tests that look at test_err from Test::Builder::Tester now use caller() 
        to get the filename - just like Test::Builder. So hopefully everything 
        should work on all platforms this time.
    -   Updated the Test::* version dependencies to something vaguely modern
    -   Fixed runtests_die.t, which still had platform-specific paths in

0.25 - or the "idiotic platform specific tests fixed" release
    -   Fixed RT#31122 that was failing tests on Strawberry Perl
        (thanks to Chris Dolan)

0.24 - or the "hating perl's broken object model" release
    -   Stopped throwing warnings when Contextual::Return was loaded due to the 
        AUTOLOADING of isa() (thank's to agianni)
    -   If you are filtering with TEST_METHOD your startup/shutdown methods 
        still get executed (thanks Chris Dolan)

0.23 - or the "damn David and his smoke testing" release
    -   Added explicit dependency on Test::Simple for those odd folk who have 
        old Test::Simple releases running with a recent Test::Builder::Tester 
        (thanks David Cantrell)

0.22 - or the "++ becomes a legal regex" release
    -   Factored out some common code
    -   Added test for Test::Class::Load not loading modules 
        successfully
    -   Tidied up all the T::C::L test libraries into t/test-libs
    -   Added patch from Nicholas Clark to make T::C work with blead 
        perl

0.21 - or the "we're all growed up" release
    -   expected_tests() gives a sensible info when given undef as an argument
    -   fixed bug when we repeatedly wrapped Test::Builder::ok with extra
        Test::Class functionality every time we run a test method
    -   Test::Class::Load only adds directories to @INC once

0.20 - or the "you failed where?" release
    -   Added an extra diagnostic line on test failures that list the method
        that failed and the class being tested. Makes locating test failures in
        test class hierarchies much simpler.
    -   Added some tests for plan math for startup/shutdown methods (phew they
        worked!)

0.19 - or the "last RT bug crushed" release
    -   You now get a sensible error message if you load Test::Class after the
        CHECK phase where the :Test attribute gets applied.
    -   Added "A NOTE ON LOADING TEST CLASSES" section that describes the issue
        of the :Test attribute being applied at CHECK time

0.18 - or the "damn multiple inheritence" release
    -   You now get a sensible error message if Test::Class's new() gets
        overridden badly via a subclass or multiple inheritance

0.17 - or the "wot I did on the train" release
    -   Removed pointless uses of UNIVERSAL::isa
    -   We rename "test name" to "test description" to confirm with current TAP
        nomenclature
    -   Added some pointers to third party documentation
    -   Added references to Test::Object, Test::Group and Test::Block
    -   Actually added spelling.t to the distro (sigh)

0.16 - or the "sepling mist ook!" release
    -   Added (optional) spelling tests for the POD in t/developer
    -   Fixed a whole bunch of spelling mistakes
    -   Added some references to Test::Class::Load in the main Test::Class POD
    -   Added more modules that use Test::Class to SEE ALSO

0.15 - or the "down. down. deeper and down" release
    -   Now works with Test::Deep, which annoyingly defines its own isa() 
        subroutine. This no longer confuses Test::Class into thinking Test::Deep
        isa Test::Class.
    -   Added some more modules that use Test::Class to SEE ALSO

0.14 - or the "for the Windows folk" release
    -   Test::Class::Load now works on Windows (thanks Kenichi Ishigaki for the 
        patch)
    -   Tests should now pass on Windows (thanks Kenichi Ishigaki again!)

0.13 - or the "just to make Ovid & David happy" release
    -   Added Test::Class::Load (thanks Ovid) to allow you to easily load
        test classes
    -   Added ability to run a specific test or set of tests based upon a
        regular expression specified in the TEST_METHOD environment variable
        (thanks to Ovid again). This mechanism is likely to change in the future
        but it's useful enough to go in now.
    -   Fixed some broken code in the POD (thanks Jeff Deifik)
    -   Removed Cwd from prerequisites - it's core

0.12 - or the "to avoid public mocking" release
    -   Fixed the installation errors that everybody has been rightly 
        complaining about for the last year:
        -   Prerequisities in requires, not build_requires
        -   Tests no longer rely on hard coded test output (thanks Mart’n 
            Ferrari and Nicholas Clark for patches)
        -   Require appropriate version of Test::Exception
    -   Added link to del.icio.us perl+testing links in POD
    -   Fixed some bad markup in the POD
    -   Stuck distribution related tests under t/developer
    -   Added Perl::Critic tests under t/developer
    -   Added some documentation for Test::Class::MethodInfo since I was bored
        with people asking what it was for (it's internal - don't use it)
    -   Added a whole bunch of people to the acknowledgements section
    
0.11
    -   A belated thank you added to some folk who send in RT bugs and whose
        name I missed off the acknowledgements section
    -   Tweaked link to XUL::Node in SEE ALSO
    -   Changed RT link so it went directly to Test::Class page
    -   An exception in a startup method now causes the rest of the tests in 
        the current test object to be ignored, and no longer gives a bogus 
        warning (reported by Emil Jansson - ta!)
    -   Added COMMUNITY section to POD

0.10
    -   Really fixed the _test_classes bug (doh!)
    -   Added :Tests attribute that acts like :Test but defaults to 'no_plan'
        if no test number is given.

0.09
    -   Fixed bug with _test_classes spotted by Corion's cpan smoker
        (see t/test_classes.t)
    -   Added links to tada to do list to TO DO section of POD
    -   Added links modules that use Test::Class to SEE ALSO section of POD
        (thanks to Terrence Brannon for suggesting this)
    
0.08
    -   The undocumented behaviour of C<runtests> has been tweaked and
        documented. You can now run all loaded test classes by doing
        Test::Class->runtests
    -   Removed undocumented autorun method, and replaced with SKIP_CLASS. This
        allows you to prevent test classes being run by runtests.
    -   Removed undocumented class method run_all_tests.
    (thanks to David Wheeler & Ovid for helping define the above behaviour)

0.07
    -   Removed Test::Class::Tutorial & Test::Class::BaseTest since
        they shouldn't have escaped into the wild quite yet. Oops.

0.06
    -   Some cosmetic POD updates

0.06_8
    -   Made tests pass with Test::Simple 0.48
    -   New signature since old one about to be revoked

0.06_7
    -   Added Module::Build support

0.06_6
    -   Fixed bogus test failures under MSWin32

0.06_5
    -   Cleaned up internals
    -   Having a single method be simultaniously a setup and teardown
        method no longer supported
    -   The undocumented add_method method, that you should not have
        been using anyway, disappears

0.06_4
    -   Fixed bogus heading styles in POD
    -   Test names that default to $self->current_method now replace all
        "_" characters with spaces to increase readability
    -   Documented default test name behaviour
    -   D'oh! Fixed MANIFEST so the distribution actually included the 
        new tests for 0.06_3 and 0.06_2

0.06_3
    -   more POD tweaks
    -   all tests now compile with warnings enabled
    -   test name now defaults to $self->current_method

0.06_2
    -   now uses inside out objects so restriction on using -test and 
        _test as hash keys has been removed
    -   tweaked POD of Test::Class
    -   you can now have spaces around test numbers, etc. (bug report
        and patch from David Wheeler)

0.06_1
    -   removed examples directory from distribution, needs rewrite
    -   removed .svn directories from distribution (doh!)
    -   removed Test::Class::Tutorial from distribution - needs rewrite
    -   removed Test::Class::BaseTest - needs rethink
    -   cleaned up Test::Class POD a bit
    -   documented.t now uses Test::Pod::Coverage if available
    -   pod.t now uses Test::Pod if available
    -   private methods now called as functions to avoid problems
        with subclasses accidentally overriding

0.05 (not distributed on CPAN)
    -   fixed MANIFEST and MANIFEST.SKIP
    -   now skips rest of tests in a test method after first failure
        due to an exception.

0.04 (not distributed on CPAN)
    -   refactored mercylessly
    -   Added Test::Class::MethodInfo
    -   Added first draft of Test::Class::Tutorial. Feedback welcome.
    -   rearranged Test::Class POD (hopefully making it clearer!)
    -   dropped total_num_tests, teardown_methods, setup_methods and 
        test_methods from public interface - they were implementation 
        details that shouldn't have been public in first place. If you 
        disagree let me know (with a rationale) and I'll probably add 
        them back :-)
    -   fixed bug where runtests() could blow up if supplied with a
        non-Test::Class
    -   fixed bug where runtests returned whether all tests had passed,
        rather than whether all test run on test object passed
    -   bug with runtests showing duplicate header lines fixed (thanks
        to Michael for adding has_plan() to Test::Builder) 
    -   FAIL_ALL now exits with the # tests failed (or 254 if
        more than 254 tests failed) to match behaviour of Test::Simple
        et al.
    -   An extra exception thrown after all the tests in a method have 
        run now causes a failed test (to better match the behaviour of a 
        die at the end of a normal test script).
    -   Changed diagnostic messages when exceptions occur to show
        method exception occurred in. Makes tracking failure easier.
    -   Added Test::Class::BaseTest - base class for creating a fixture
        and testing it's of the correct class.
    -   Diagnostic messages improved
    -   Plan correctly shown when setup/teardown method without any
        tests throws an exception
    -   TEST_VERBOSE now outputs a newline before the method name which
        makes reading verbose output easier.
    -   Added startup and shutdown methods after suggestion from
        Tony Bowden.
    -   Added run_all_classes and autorun - inspired by comments from 
        Tony Bowden on running multiple Test::Classes easily
    -   Changed runtests so that it will run all of a classes 
        autorunnable sub-classes if called as a class method with no 
        arguments.

0.03  Thu Jun 20
    -   fixed README
    -   fixed tests that broke now Test::Builder (quite rightly) can
